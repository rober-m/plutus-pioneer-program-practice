IMP: Explanation of the idea behind the code:

To have true NFTs, we must prevent to be more than one mintin transaction for a token. The minting
policy has to return True in only one transaction. It must be impossible to to the same again in
another transaction (even in the same Slot).

The key is that we need something in the Cardano blockchain that we can refer in our minting policy
that is unique and can only exist in one transaction and never again. That something is UTXOs

UTXOs can only exist once and all UTXOS are unique. To pinpoint a specifi UTXO, you have to pinpoint
a specific transaction via it's transaction ID, and in that transaction you have to specify which 
output of that transaciton is the UTXO needed via the index (UTXOS are ordered). 

So, UTXOs are unique because transactions are unique. And transactions are unique because of the
fees.
If it wasn't for the fees, we could have a transaction that has zero inputs and only outpts without
value. And such a transaction could exist multiple times, because we could have the exact same
inputs and exact same hash. But, in a system with fees (like Cardano), you can't have such
transaction becaus you'll always need to have some input to pay the fees. And as soon as you have
an input, that input has to come from somewhere â€” a previous UTXO. Because we can't have
double spending, no transaction will have the same inputs, and therefore, no trasnaction will have
the same hash (ID).

By passing a specific UTXO (it doesn't matter which one) as a parameter to our minting policy and
checking in the policy that the minting transaction consumes said UTXO, we can guarantee uniqueness.

We pass two parameters:
    - One of type TxOutRef that references the transaction output that we want to consume.
    - One of type TokenName with the NFT name.

We have to check two thigs: That the UTxO specified by oref is consumend, and that we only mint
the token once.

    Each transaction inputs is another transaction output.

    `any` is a standard Haskell function that checks if any (at least one) element of a list 
    satisfies a condition. `any` takes two parameters: A condition and a list.
    
    To get the inputs of our transaction we can pass our `info :: TxInfo` to
    `txInfoInputs` and we'll obtain a value of type [TxInInfo].

    Then, for each value (input) of that list, we extract the reference of the output that this
    value reference using `txInInfoOutRef ` and we check if it equals the given oref.

    If any of the outputs equals oref, we consumed said UTxO and we return True.
