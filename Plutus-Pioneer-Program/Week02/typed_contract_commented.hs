{-
This contract is basically the same as the FortyTwo contract but with types.
I'll only comment the changes, everything else, look for in the gift and
FortyTwo contracts.

{-# INLINABLE mkValidator #-}
{-
Having Datum, Redeemer, and Context as BuitinData is usefull for efficient computation,
but having strong types specific for the use-case is much more convenient (and helpful 
to learn Plutus).

Its important to notice that using strong types has an impact on the resources needed to
execute the contract. The compile Plutus code, the number of executions needed, and the
memory consumption, all become bigger. But we'll worry about that once we become skilled
Plutus developers.

In this contract, we don't care about the Datum, so we'll define it as a value of type ().
As a redeemeer, we'll use an Integer. We'll compare if that integer is 42, and if it is, the
validator passes (same as the FortyTwo contract). And finally, we'll use ScriptContext as the
type for the script context value.

The final change is that now the validator returns a Bool (True or False). True if the validation
passes, False or error otherwise.
-}
mkValidator :: () -> Integer -> ScriptContext -> Bool
{-
Like before, we'll only care about the redeemer, so we'll ignore the Datum and ScriptContext.
The logic of mkValidator could be:

    mkValidator _ r _ = r == 42

That would work as espected. But ind the case that we get a script failuer, we wouldn't be 
able to differentiate why, and it would be hard to debug. In this case, it's not really
needed, but it's important for when we have a more complex validation going on.

To solve that, we'll use the traceIfFalse function (traceIfFalse :: BuiltinString -> Bool -> Bool)
that takes the string to show if the Bool passed as a second argument is false, and it 
returns that same Bool.
-}
mkValidator _ r _ = traceIfFalse "wrong redeemer" $ r == 42
{-
Because we now use strong types for the mkValidator parameters, we need to write some more
boilerplate code to be able to compile it to Plutus core.

First, we need to create a new type that encodes the information about the type of
the Datum and the Redeemer.

We'll call it Typed, but you can call it however you want. This type won't have any 
constructors because we'll never need a value of this type. This is only used to
provide the instance of the class Scripts.ValidatorTypes for the Typed type.

In Typed, we record that our DatumType will be of type (), and that our RedeemerType
will be of type Integer.

Note: Now, the scripts come from Sc Ledger.Typed.Scripts so we can use the typed version
of the scripts.
-}
data Typed
instance Scripts.ValidatorTypes Typed where
    type instance DatumType Typed = ()
    type instance RedeemerType Typed = Integer

{-
To do the actual compilation to Plutus core, we now have to use the mkTypedValidator
function, that takes TODO

The wrapValidator converts the BuiltinData types into the types that we defined.
Then, our custom logic that we defined in mkValidator is executed, and finally,
if the validator returns True we translate it into (), else we translate it
into an exception.
