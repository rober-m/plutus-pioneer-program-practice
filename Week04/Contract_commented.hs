Overview of the Contract monad parameter types:

              Contract w s e a

- w -> Allow the contract to write messages of type 'w' to communicate with othe contracts. 'w' is visible from outside world.
    
- s -> Specifies the endpoints available in the contract.

- e -> Type of the error messages.

- a -> As with all monads, the last one is the result type. 'a' is the overall result of the computation.

{-
We'll create a contract that doesn't write messages (unit), doesn't have endpoints (Empty), has
errors of type Text, and returns unit. The only thing that we contract will do is to log something.

We use Text because it's much more efficient than String for text data.
-}
myContract1 :: Contract () Empty Text ()
myContract1 = do
    {-
    thrwowError throws an exeption with any message that we want to specify (of type Text in this case).
    If the contract throws an exeption, it stops the execution right there. So, if we thrrow an exeption
    here, we wont see the log that we'll add below.
    
    We have to specify that thrwoError comes from Contract because the EmulatorTrace monad also has a
    throwError function.
    
    We don't need to specify @String like logInfo below because we already indicated the type in the
    signature of myContract1.

    We pass the result of throwError to void to a-void :D the warning that we are not using
    the value. 
    -}
    void $ Contract.throwError "BOOM!"
    {-
    logInfo (polimorphic) takes anything that's serializable (has ToJSON instance), logs it, and 
    returns a Contract.
    In this case we pass a literal string. But because we are using the OverloadedStrings extension,
    logInfo doesn't know which type it is. So we specify the type by adding @String using TypeApplications.

    We have to specify that logInfo comes from Contract because the EmulatorTrace monad also has a
    logInfo function.
    -}
    Contract.logInfo @String "hello from the contract"

-- I'll create an EmulatorTrace called myTrace1
myTrace1 :: EmulatorTrace ()
{-
The only thing myTrace1 will do is to activate myContract1. We'll pass Wallet 1 because we need
to pass a wallet. Because we spacified that we'll return unit, we have to change the ContractHandle
that activateContractWallet returns for a unit using void.

This will execute the contract and the contract will log the message we wrote.
-}
myTrace1 = void $ activateContractWallet (knownWallet 1) myContract1

-- To test myTrace1 we use runEmulatorTraceIO
test1 :: IO ()
test1 = runEmulatorTraceIO myTrace1

-- ################################################################################################
-- ######################################## EXAMPLE 2 #############################################
-- In this example, we'll run myContract1 of EXAMPLE 1, but catch and handle the exeption.

{-
Same signature as myContract1 but we changed the error type to Void.

Void (Data.Void) is a type that has no values. It's different than unit because unit has only one
value: the unit. But Void has no value at all.

By changing the error type to Void, we indicate that this contract can't possibly throw an exeption.
Because you vould have to provide a value of type Void to throwError, and there is no value of
type Void.
-}
myContract2 :: Contract () Empty Void ()
{-
To handle the exeption we'll use handleError:

handleError :: (e -> Contract w s e' a) -> Contract w s e a -> Contract w s e' a

handleError takes two arguments: A handle from "e" to a Contract where the error could potentiallly
change "e'", and a Contract with error of type "e". And returns the same Contract but with the error
type of "e'".

handleError executes Contract provided as a second argument. If there is no exeption, we get the result
of type "a" and handleError returns that "a" without modification. If there is an exeption of type "e",
then we apply our handler and get a contract with error type "e'" and run that one instead.
-}
myContract2 = Contract.handleError
    {-
    "err" is of type Text because myContract1 (second argument) has an error of type Text.
    logError is the same as logInfo but logs the message at the Error level.

    Because we want to concatenatenate "caught: " with the error and the error is of type Text,
    we have to convert it to type String. Text provides a function for just that called unpack.

    This time I don't need to specify @String because unpack returns a String and the compiler
    can infer that the result of the concatenation is a text of type String.
