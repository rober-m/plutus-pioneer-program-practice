information needed is provided by the Datum, so we pass ().

mkValidator :: VestingDatum -> () -> ScriptContext -> Bool

This time we'll use the ScriptContext.

The validator has to check two things in the transaction that unlocks the funds:
- That it's signed by the beneficiary (signedByBeneficiary :: Bool)
- That the deadline has been reached (deadlineReached :: Bool)

If any of those two conditions are false, the validator rejects the transaction.

    signedByBeneficiary :: Bool
    {-
    To know if the transaction has been signed by the beneficiary, first we'll extract
    the beneficiary from the Datum (beneficiary dat), then we extract the PubKeyHash using
    the unPaymentPubKeyHash record. Now, we have the public key hash of beneficiary, and we
    have the TxInfo of the transaction.
    
    To check if a transaction has been signed by a specifc
    PubKeyHash, we have the helper function txSignedBy. txSigned by takes a Txinfo and a PubKeyHash
    and returns True if TxInfo is signed by PubkeyHash and False otherwise.
    -}
    signedByBeneficiary = txSignedBy info $ unPaymentPubKeyHash $ beneficiary dat

    deadlineReached :: Bool
    {-
     To check if a deadline has been reached, we can use the contains function. The contains
    function takes two values of type Interval and returns True if the first Interval is entirely
    contained in the second Interval and False otherwise. By checking that an interval that starts
    at the deadline is contained in the transaction's valid inteval range, we can be sure that the
    deadline has been reached.

    To create the first interval we'll use the from function, that takes a value "a" and produces an
    Interval that includes all values that are greater or equal to "a". passing the deadline of dat
    we obtain an interval that goes from the deadline until the end of times.

    The second interval is already provided by the transaction. We can extract it by using
    txInfoValidRange.
